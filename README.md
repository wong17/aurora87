## Description

In the year 2087, humanity faces extinction when a polar meltdown triggers a virus that turns people into ravenous undead. With major cities collapsing and the planet overrun by hordes of zombies, the remaining governments activate a desperate plan: 'Project Exodus'. This plan involves sending the survivors to a lunar colony. Initially, the colony, called 'New Aurora', brings hope, but tragedy strikes when an infected evacuee causes chaos and spreads the virus among the colonists. The protagonist, the sole survivor, must contain the infection, but faces an even greater threat when the infected individual on the moon sends a signal to Earth, drawing more zombies to the colony via automated supply ships. Tension mounts as the protagonist struggles to survive and save humanity from these mutant creatures.

Available soon... working on it.
